**JavaScript**

_Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML._

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

_Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display._
  
External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages. JavaScript files have the file extension **.js.**
To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
  
Example: <script src="myScript.js"></script>

_External scripts cannot contain <script> tags._
